                What are fighter aircrafts?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Fighter aircrafts are designed to engage in air-to-air combat and do so to secure or defend a specific part
                of an airspace. This means fighter jets play an essential part in war and a status of power, which is why so 
                many goverments would rather put taxpayer's money into military assets such as these aircrafts than into free 
                healthcare. (Not being specific.)
